# Motivation:
Ive spent a lot of time working with small businesses and one of he hardest metrics to measure is costumer satisfaction. Sure it is easy to have consumers when there is an affordable, useful product but there is always room for improvement. 

This application was created with small businesses in mind. For owners to be able to Interact directly with their clients without doing any of the hard work. With the capability of sending one email to over 1000+ customers this application can change the way businesses interact with their clients.
